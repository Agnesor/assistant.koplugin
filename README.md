A powerful plugin that lets you interact with AI language models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama etc.) while reading. Ask questions about text, get translations, summaries, explanations and more - all without leaving your book.

<small>Originally forked from deleted fork of  [zeeyado](https://github.com/zeeyado)  of [AskGPT](https://github.com/drewbaumann/askgpt),then modified using WindSurf.</small>

## Features

- **Ask Questions**: Highlight text and ask questions about it
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for:
  - Anthropic's Claude 
  - OpenAI's GPT models
  - Gemini
  - OpenRouter: unified interface for LLMs
  - DeepSeek
  - Ollama
  - Other OpenAI compatible API services (grok, nvidia ...)
- **Builtin Prompts**:
  - **Dictionary** : Get synonyms, context-aware dictionary explanation and example for the selected word. (thanks to [plateaukao](https://github.com/plateaukao))
  - **Recap** : Get a quick recap of a book when you open it, for books that haven't been opened in 28 hrs and <95% complete. Also available via shortcut/gesture for on-demand access. Fully configurable prompts. (thanks to [jbhul](https://github.com/jbhul))
- **Custom Prompts**: Create your own specialized AI helpers with their own quick actions and prompts
  - **Translation**: Instantly translate highlighted text to any language
  - **Quick Actions**: One-click buttons for common tasks like summarizing or explaining
- **Additional Questions** : Ask addtional questions about the highlighted text using your custom prompts
- **Smart Display**: Automatically hides long text snippets for cleaner viewing
  - **Markdown Support**: (thanks to [David Fan](https://github.com/d-fan))

- **"Add to Note" and "Copy to Clipboard"**: Easily add whole dialog as a note to highlighted text or copy to use for later.
- **Quick Access** : Ability to access some of custom prompts directly from the main highlight menu (Configurable).
- **Gesture-Enabled Prompts**: You can assign gestures to **Ask** and **Recap**. This enables the user to ask anything about the book without needing to highlight text first. It also enables triggering the recap at any time. Additionally, you can access these prompts through a [quick menu](https://koreader.rocks/user_guide/#L1-qmandprofiles) as well.

    - Adjust order of custom buttons
    - Make some custom buttons display on the main popup

Configuration file has this structure:

    provider = "openai",
    -- or 
    provider = "openai_grok", -- latter one is in effective
    
    -- Provider-specific settings (override defaults in api_handlers/defaults.lua)
    provider_settings = {
        openai = {
            model = "api-model",
            base_url = "URL_to_API",
            api_key = "your-api-key", -- set your api key here
            additional_parameters = {
              --.. other parameters
            }
        },  
        openai_grok = { -- using same openai handler for compatible API, eg grok
            model = "grok-3-mini-fast", -- see: https://x.ai/api
            base_url = "https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions",
            api_key = "your-grok-api-key", -- set your api key here
        },
        -- ... other AI providers
    },
    
    -- Optional features, replace each "Turkish" with your desired language
    features = {
        hide_highlighted_text = false,  -- Set to true to hide the highlighted text at the top
        hide_long_highlights = true,    -- Hide highlighted text if longer than threshold
        long_highlight_threshold = 500,  -- Number of characters considered "long",
        system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant that provides clear explanations and if not stated oterwise always answers in Turkish .", -- Custom system prompt for the AI ("Ask" button) to override the default, to disable set to nil
        refresh_screen_after_displaying_results = true, -- Set to true to refresh the screen after displaying the results
        show_dictionary_button_in_main_popup = true, -- Set to true to show the dictionary button in the main popup
        dictionary_translate_to = "tr-TR", -- Set to the desired language code for the dictionary, nil to hide it

        -- AI Recap configuration (optional)
        recap_config = {
            system_prompt = "You are a book recap giver with entertaining tone...", -- Custom system prompt for recap
            user_prompt = "{title} by {author} that has been {progress}% read...", -- Custom user prompt template with variables
            language = "tr-TR" -- Language for recap responses, uses dictionary_translate_to as fallback
        },

        -- Custom prompts for the AI (text = button text in the UI). system-prompt defaults to "You are a helpful assistant." if not set.
        prompts = {
            prompt_id = {
                text = "prompt_name",
                order = 1, -- give order to buttons to fix the order of them
                system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant that ....",
                user_prompt = "Please ...  in Turkish: ",
                show_on_main_popup = false -- Show the button in main popup    
            },
            -- ... other prompts
